C - Binary trees

This repository delves into the world of binary trees, exploring their structure, operations, and applications.

## What's Inside

Here's a glimpse of what you'll find within this project:

Implementations:
Core binary tree operations (insertion, deletion, traversals)
Various tree traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
Tree balancing techniques (AVL trees, red-black trees)
Visualizations:
Interactive demos to visualize tree structures and operations (if applicable)
Clear diagrams to illustrate key concepts
Algorithms:
Search algorithms (breadth-first search, depth-first search)
Tree traversal algorithms
Applications:
Examples of real-world problems solved using binary trees.
